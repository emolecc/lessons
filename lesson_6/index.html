                  There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                  alteration
                  in
                  some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you
                  are
                  going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in

            <p class="unique">'Practice Makes Perfect' is such a well-known saying, and in a way it is true.</p>
            <p>
               Perfection is the aim for the highest degree of excellence or quality, whilst Practice is the repeated
               performance to acquire skill or proficiency. Practice is the pathway to perfection.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="block1">
            <p>
               Perfection does have its place, it gives you something to work towards, gives focus, and clarity. The
               problem happens when it turns into a habit of 'how' you automatically do things. When it's switched on
               all the time without checking if what you are doing right now warrants such high standards and becomes
               ingrained in your personality.
            </p>

               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur elementum malesuada dolor vel rhoncus.
               Aenean mollis tellus id quam faucibus accumsan. Duis dapibus, odio sit amet interdum viverra, mauris
               lorem vulputate nibh, et dapibus tellus quam vitae erat. Praesent euismod nunc nec fringilla viverra.
               Duis convallis neque sit amet mauris laoreet malesuada. Aliquam posuere hendrerit interdum. Nullam ornare

            Aiming for perfection, for perfection's sake, can be addictive when it becomes the sole point of what you do
            and can impact on your motivation behind your work. Are you creating purely for achieving perfection or for
            the unbounded self-expression and passion for your work?
         </span>
         <span class="inline">
            I now say, 'Practice Makes Progress', as I find it is more flexible and forgiving. As a perfectionist myself
            I know the dangers of its illusionary trap. Practice makes progress, for me, comes from a less critical
            place and encourages exploration whilst enjoying the process for what it is.
